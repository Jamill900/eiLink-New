          The framework of the project was to develop a Machine Learning (ML) based model for one of our clients in the
          oil & gas industry to qualitatively identify sand production events by classifying signals created by sand
          particles and other sources.
          <br><br>
          Sand production is a major risk for safe and economical operations. The failure to develop an accurate sand
          production models costs the oil and gas industry significant resources to either repair or reinstall well
          equipment. The identification of a sand event in real-time is not trivial. The most reliable way to detect
          sand events precisely would be sampling and further laboratory measurements. However, this cannot be done on
          field with hundreds of wells continuously and at any time. An alternative option is to monitor the well with
          non-intrusive acoustic sand detector (ASD), which, among any other existing signals, measures the noise of
          collision of sand particles with pipe wall in an elbow.
          <br><br>
          ASD signal is interference of multiples acoustic sources. Complexity requires development of advance
          algorithms to eliminate abundant false notifications of conventional. False notifications can occur due to
          change in flow regime, choke, gas lift rate, or environmental noises. Laboratory works also prove that
          detection of sand events by acoustic detectors is very complicated process and gave motivation for application
          of machine and deep learning methodologies in the scope of this study.
          <br><br>
          The study focused on detecting sand production events using machine learning techniques in an oil field.
          Events with sand concentration above 5 pptb were considered as sand events. The data ware collected from wells
          with various petrophysical properties, and the dataset included parameters such as pressure, choke, and
          acoustic detector signals. The training and testing dataset was prepared with labeled samples for sand and
          no-sand events and statistical features were extracted from the labeled data.
          <br><br>
          Different machine learning algorithms were examined. The results illustrate that the decision tree based
          ensemble models were the ones that have the highest accuracy. The selected Random Forest Classifier model was
          tested on 16 wells for 332 sand event and the accuracy of the RFC model was 76.8%.
          <br><br>
          There are numerous advantages of using ML algorithm. ML algorithm helps to handle high number of the wells
          (e.g. 100+ wells for a given field) simultaneously. It is unbiased data driven methodology based on historical
          events. ML algorithm can recognize data-inherited “unseen” tendencies and enhances sand monitoring capability
          for petroleum engineers. It also increases reliability of acoustic sand detector when used together.

          Wax precipitation is one of the most challenging flow assurance problems in the oil and gas industry, as it
          can lead to flow issues, equipment failures, and production loss. This is a complex process that involves both
          phase separation and solidification.

          It is critical to be able to accurately predict the amount of precipitated wax for each well in order to avoid
          problems during intervention into the well. Our team developed Perturbed Chain Statistical Associating Fluid
          Theory to accurately predict temperature (WAT) and amount of precipitated wax without the use of costly PNA
          analysis. The advantage of PC-SAFT is mainly its accuracy in the estimation of the frugalities of heavy
          components in vapor and liquid mixtures.
          <br><br>
          We know that the composition of wax is different across the field, which makes it more difficult to predict
          wax precipitation if wax is represented as one component. We used a different approach by dividing the
          reservoir into sectors with similar wax properties, calibrating each sector separately, and obtaining one set
          of PC-SAFT parameters for every sector. If prediction of a new well is required in the future, then the sector
          to which this well belongs needs to be determined, and this calibrated set of parameters for that part can be
          used.
          <br><br>
          Feed-Forward Neural Network trained on Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) data was used to predict the
          temperature inside the wellbore based on the production data for each well. Usually, the temperature of the
          oil in the flow center is hotter than DTS. Therefore, the heat transfer equation was used to model the radial
          temperature gradient and therefore determine the temperature of the oil flowing inside the tubing. Applying
          the heat transfer equation increases the accuracy of the PC-SAFT model and enables company engineers to
          compare and identify all wells with a high risk of wax precipitation and, thus, to know about the risk of wax
          precipitation before intervention into the well.

          A developed thermodynamic model used sensitivity analysis in order to identify what affects wax precipitation
          the most, such as gas/oil ratio (GOR), pressure, and temperature. According to sensitivity analysis,
          temperature is a dominant parameter. Depending on the temperature drop, it may increase the amount of
          precipitated wax by 2–4 times.

          The Sand ML Shahdeniz product is an advanced software solution designed to address the critical challenge of
          sand detection in gas wells. It harnesses the power of Machine Learning (ML) to automatically and accurately
          identify sand occurrences in real-time. By analyzing data from multiple sensors, including Acoustic Sand
          Detector (ASD), Downhole Pressure (DHP), and choke, the product provides timely alerts to operators, enabling

          developed to revolutionize sand detection, providing an automated and reliable solution that detects sand
          events promptly, allowing operators to make informed decisions to optimize gas well production.
          <br><br>
          The Sand ML Shahdeniz product employs an ensemble of Artificial Intelligence and Rule-Based Algorithm. The AI
          model, namely Aunoencoder, learns to reconstruct the input data and can identify patterns and anomalies in the
