                    The South Caspian Basin (SCB) is a young basin with a sedimentary rock column up to 25 km thick.
                    High sedimentation rates, combined with other factors, resulted in abnormally high pore pressures,
                    particularly in shales, over the last 5 million years. Understanding the nature and distribution of
                    overpressure is a critical issue in exploration and reservoir engineering concepts, as well as
                    drilling and completion operations. This project investigates the relationship between the effective
                    stress and porosity in the shales of the Productive Series and how it is affected by the shale
                    volume. Two disequilibrium compaction models, one proposed by Aplin et.al. (1995), and the second by
                    Schneider et. al. (1994) were tested in the SCB for the first time.

                    It is common during field development that certain areas of the structure, while containing
                    appreciable oil and gas reserves, are complicated and negatively affected by certain geological
                    features. Sometimes, vital information regarding reservoir properties and characterization is
                    difficult or impossible to obtain from these regions for various reasons, which may include:

                    In the Deep Water Gunashli (DWG) oil field, the complex, steeply dipping northern limb of the
                    structure has historically been underdeveloped due to the presence of severe reservoir properties
                    degradation associated with deformation bands. Recently, an appraisal campaign has been launched to
                    understand the reservoir potential in this area. The vital part of this campaign was the Yasamal
                    Analogue Outcrop Study done by the eiLink Team.

                    Then, during the second phase of the project, the focus was to QC the acquired data and use it to
                    come up with an essential geological analysis. The main objective was to observe what controls the
                    presence and distribution of deformation bands in the outcrops. Finally, a similar analysis was made
                    using subsurface data acquired from wells drilled in similar geological settings within the DWG

                    chosen as study locations, where data was mainly acquired along stratigraphy to mimic the subsurface
                    setting. Prior to acquiring the data, the outcrop was cleaned from dust and other undesirable

                    For instance, it was observed that there is a cut-off value of the Vshale derived from the GR log,
                    indicating the presence of deformation bands as a function of shale content. Also, there is a good

                    been exposed to) and the distribution of deformation bands per unit area. Finally, it was observed

                    Estimation of the recovery factor from structurally deformed areas is a challenging process due to
                    the high number of unknown parameters. These features are of subseismic scale, which are usually

                    Significant water reserves have been found in depths below 300 meters. The water due to the

                    Formation of water salinity is important for understanding the hydrodynamic system in a sedimentary
                    basin, including areas of hydraulic communication and isolation, and has implications for the
                    prediction of formation pressure, characterization of hydrocarbon migration pathways, and estimating
                    the risk of a trap being flushed. An unknown mechanism of formation water salinity distribution in
                    Shahdeniz creates challenges from several aspects, as it impacts log resistivity readings, which
                    results in erroneous saturation estimations. Among existing methods of predicting salinity, the most
                    effective is a direct measurement of water resistivity or brine chemistry analysis. The pitfall of
                    these methods is that they require core extraction from a well. Our product is able to predict
                    formation water salinity using the available well data, as well as to understand the mechanism of
                    salinity distribution and impacting factors like rock mineralogy, impact of ultra-dispersed
                    particles (UDP), capillary pressure, dynamic disequilibrium, etc.

                    Several types of challenges take place during drilling that include wellbore instability, stuck
                    pipe, fluid losses, etc. Reasons associated with these problems are understood to some degree on a
                    qualitative level, but it is unclear in which conditions the combination of different drilling and
                    rock parameters results in a drilling issue. Additionally, no tool exists that can predict the risks
                    prior to drilling. The goal of the project was to create a tool that can analyze all drilling
                    parameters (ROP, RPM, PRESSPIPE, etc.) in combination with rock properties (V-shale, DEN) and PPFG
                    data ( pore pressure, fracture pressure) and give a prediction of the probability of risk
                    occurrence.

                    Sustained casing pressure (SCP), defined as excessive casing pressure that constantly rebuilds after
                    bleed-down, is undesirable and sometimes potentially dangerous for producing wells. It is a
                    complicated phenomenon which cannot be described only with annulus pressure build-ups without
                    integrated analysis of other parameters.
                    <br><br>
                    We developed a tool to improve monitoring of annulus pressures and detection of build-ups with
                    minimum input by engineers. The tool allows engineers to easily separate build-up events caused by
                    downhole pressure and temperature effects and to pay more attention to specific problematic ones. In
                    order to determine the relationship between different parameters, Pearson’s correlation coefficient
                    has been used.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, the tool also demonstrates the relationship between downhole pressure of Cutting
                    Re-Injection wells and B and C annuli of oil producing wells.
                    <br><br>
                    Our tool minimizes the work done by engineers by giving information about potential build-ups for
                    different time periods and increases success for well integrity with improved monitoring and
                    detection. It reduces analysis time and makes it possible to track and analyze around 200 well
                    annulus pressure measurements simultaneously.
